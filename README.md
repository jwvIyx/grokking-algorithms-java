# Grokking Algorithms - Java Implementations
This repository contains implementations of algorithms from the book "Grokking Algorithms" in Java. The primary objective is to implement and explore the algorithms learned in the book as a way of solidifying understanding and enhancing learning. By coding these algorithms, the goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how they work and how to apply them in real-world programming tasks.

## Implementations
[Binary Search]() - Implementation of the binary search algorithm, one of the most efficient ways to search in a sorted array.  
[Linear vs Binary Search]() - This comparison measures the execution time of binary search and linear search on a sorted array (while both algorithms work on sorted data, binary search is much faster for large datasets)
